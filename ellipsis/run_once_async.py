    Ensure that an async function is executed only once.

    On the first invocation the wrapped coroutine is scheduled as an
    asyncio.Task on the current running event loop and its Task is cached.
    Later invocations return/await the same Task, receiving the same result or
    propagated exception. Requires an active running event loop when the
    wrapped function is first called.

             raised propagated to callers.
