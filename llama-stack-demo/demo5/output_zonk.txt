Response content: "ZONK" refers to an element in the videogame Supaplex. In the game, a Zonk is depicted as a round rock, and it is a common and typically unpleasant obstacle. Zonks tend to fall downwards whenever possible, for instance, if there is a void directly underneath them. Players must be cautious as a Zonk falling on the character (Murphy) results in an explosion and game-over for the player. Murphy can push Zonks laterally (but not vertically) if there is space for them to move, but can only push one Zonk at a time. Good timing is needed to use Zonks strategically, such as dropping them on top of enemies (like Snik-snaks) to eliminate them through explosions.
